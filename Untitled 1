=========Starting RestAPI==========

1. create a project with the following dependency
  #Spring web
  #Spring mySQL Driver
  #Spring Data JPA
  #Lombok
  
2.Create packages in the main package
    #controller
    #repository
    #service
    #model/entity
3.Configure MySQL database
  #create a database in MySQL
  #configure it in the project application.properties file in resources folder

4.create classes in all new created packages and create interface in only repository package
  ->Don't forget to put annotation based on package
   repository====>> @Repository (JpaRepository interface already provide @Repository annotation so we don't need put this in the reposity class when we will use jpaRepository)
   controller====>> @RestController
   service=====>> @Service / @Component
   model ====> @Entity (if you use lombok than you have to use @Data annotation)
5. specifies primary key in the Entity class using @Id annotation   

6. create a exception package to handle the exception and in the class use @ResponsesSatus annotation

7.Create REST API in the controller Class
